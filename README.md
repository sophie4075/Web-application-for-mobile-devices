## Overview
This project is an example application built using a custom framework designed for educational purposes at the university. It manages media items (e.g., images and videos) and supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) both locally and remotely. The application is composed of various view controllers and utility classes that manage the interaction between the user and the data.
